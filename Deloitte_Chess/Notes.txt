- We need to create a RATING of players at the end of the training set (month 132). 
An important variable to predict new outcomes is the last played games (to assess how strongly a player was performing). 


PREDICTORS:
- rating ELO number
- results of last played games
- plays with white (the higher on the ranking the most it counts)
